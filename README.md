# FDS-Coding-Project

Write a Python code, which

• reads the data from a datafile located at the same directory as the Python code, and stores it in an array;

• creates another array, representing the distribution of newborn weights in a given dataset;

• plots this array as a histogram;

• uses the distribution to calculate W˜ , the average weight of newborn babies in the given region;

• uses the distribution to calculate another value, X (see section ‘Your data file and required value’ below
to find out what value X you are required to calculate), and

• prints both values, W˜ and X, on the graph.

The code should create one graph only. This graph must have adequate axis labels, titles and a legend
